      <p>
       My name is Tiernan Green. I've been learning how to code for the last six months, starting with the basics of CSS, Javascript and HTML and finally recently moving on
       to full-stack web applications. It's been a difficult journey, however I am now more confident in my abilities and a lot more knowledgeable.
       Anything I do not know presently, I am certain with research and practice I will be able to puck up very quickly!
